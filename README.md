# 🔐 Authentication System

A simple **Authentication System** built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. It allows users to **Sign Up** and **Log In**. This version is focused on basic functionality and **does not use password hashing**, making it suitable for learning and testing.

> ⚠️ **Security Warning:** This system stores plain-text passwords. Do **not** use it in production without implementing proper password hashing (e.g., `bcrypt`).
